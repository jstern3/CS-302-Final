How To Play:
Simply clicking on the exe file in this git hub should allow you to play our game

Controls:
Use left and right arrow keys to move
Use the up arrow to jump
Hold the down arrow when on a thin platform to drop through
Press the spacebar to shoot bullets

Bugs/Issues:
You can fall into the void if you move left in the starting room.
Pressing up while inside, or pressing up against a platform will let you double jump in mid air.
Enemies not killed are currently not deleted.
Game currently goes on forever, intended to end after around 15 rooms, but this is currently not implemented.

Additional Info:
The code that contains our CS302 data structure is RoomGenerator.cs
We used the built in unity version control instead of GitHub to facilitate collaboration, a photo has been provided on GitHub to show proof of this, sorry for the inconvience.
